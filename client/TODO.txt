I still need to make a login system so maybe hardcode cid for now unless i can get to it in time

landingScreen.js:
    -useEffect to fetch list of restaurants.

Menu.js:
    -useEffect(): fetch restaurant items
    -addToCart(): store item to backend in order model as a cart item. Store quantity as 1.
    -removedFromCart(): remove the item as a cart item when this button is clicked.
    -checkout(): should change cart status to ordered in the backend. (still need to make delivery/pickup time so hardcode for now if needed)

cart.components.jsx:
    -useEffect to fetch user cart items
    -handleQuantityChange(): change the quantity of the item in the backend when this function is called.
